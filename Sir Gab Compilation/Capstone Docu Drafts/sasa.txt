journal - week 1 and 2

feb 12-23

My first whole week was filled with a lot of emotions because I became excited and curious about our lessons for the subjects we have with both teachers. We have a cyber security subject that makes me more curious because I've been wanting to pursue a career in cyber security in the future. Because of that, the subject has captured my attention and made me excited to discover how cyber security works and why it is important. In our capstone subject, we formed a group. Luckily, some of my group members are already my friends, including Claire, my BFF. In our second class, our teacher gave us a coding exercise using the PHP language, and we learned it by understanding it ourselves. He also assigned us a first activity.

In my second week, we continued with the lessons in cyber security, and on the other days, we focused on our capstone subject. Sir Gab gave us our first group activity where we needed to analyze the given situations from the example client. In the PHP class, our teacher assigned us another exercise and activity to be completed on that day.

To summarize, my two weeks were a bit exhausting but enjoyable because I learned something new that motivated me to not become a lazy student.
